**aiomonitor** is a module that adds monitor and cli capabilities
for asyncio_ applications. Idea and code were borrowed from curio_ project.
Task monitor that runs concurrently to the asyncio_ loop (or fast drop-in
replacement uvloop_) in a separate thread as result monitor will work even if
the event loop is blocked for some reason.

This library provides a python console using aioconsole_ module. It is possible
to execute asynchronous commands inside your running application. Extensible
with you own commands, in the style of the standard library's cmd_ module

Installation
------------
Installation process is simple, just::

    $ pip install aiomonitor


Example
-------
Monitor has context manager interface:

.. code:: python

    import aiomonitor

    async def main():
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        run_forever = loop.create_future()
        with aiomonitor.start_monitor(loop):
            await run_forever

    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass

Now from separate terminal it is possible to connect to the application::

    $ telnet localhost 20101

or the included python client::

    $ python -m aiomonitor.cli


Tutorial
--------

Let's create a simple aiohttp_ application, and see how ``aiomonitor`` can
be integrated with it.

.. code:: python

    import asyncio

    import aiomonitor
    from aiohttp import web

    # Simple handler that returns response after 100s
    async def simple(request):
        print('Start sleeping')
        await asyncio.sleep(100)
        return web.Response(text="Simple answer")

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    # create application and register route
    app = web.Application()
    app.router.add_get('/simple', simple)

    # it is possible to pass a dictionary with local variables
    # to the python console environment
    host, port = "localhost", 8090
    locals_ = {"port": port, "host": host}
    # init monitor just before run_app
    with aiomonitor.start_monitor(loop=loop, locals=locals_):
        # run application with built-in aiohttp run_app function
        web.run_app(app, port=port, host=host, loop=loop)

Let's save this code in file ``simple_srv.py``, so we can run it with the following command::

    $ python simple_srv.py
    ======== Running on http://localhost:8090 ========
    (Press CTRL+C to quit)

And now one can connect to a running application from a separate terminal, with
the ``telnet`` command, and ``aiomonitor`` will immediately respond with prompt::

    $ telnet localhost 20101
    Asyncio Monitor: 1 tasks running
    Type help for commands
    monitor >>>

Now you can type commands, for instance, ``help``::

    monitor >>> help
    Usage: help [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      To see the usage of each command, run them with "--help" option.

    Commands:
      cancel                  Cancel an indicated task
      console                 Switch to async Python REPL
      exit (q,quit)           Leave the monitor client session
      help (?,h)              Show the list of commands
      ps (p)                  Show task table
      ps-terminated (pst,pt)  List recently terminated/cancelled tasks
      signal                  Send a Unix signal
      stacktrace (st,stack)   Print a stack trace from the event loop thread
      where (w)               Show stack frames and the task creation chain of a task
      where-terminated (wt)   Show stack frames and the termination/cancellation chain of a task

``aiomonitor`` also supports async python console inside a running event loop
so you can explore the state of your application::

    monitor >>> console
    Python 3.10.7 (main, Sep  9 2022, 12:31:20) [Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    ---
    This console is running in an asyncio event loop.
    It allows you to wait for coroutines using the 'await' syntax.
    Try: await asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)
    ---
    >>> await asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)
    3
    >>>

To leave the console type ``exit()`` or press Ctrl+D::

    >>> exit()

    âœ“ The console session is closed.
    monitor >>>

Extension
---------

Additional console variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may add more variables that can be directly referenced in the ``console`` command.
Refer `the console-variables example code <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomonitor/tree/main/examples/console-variables.py>`_

Custom console commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``aiomonitor`` is very easy to extend with your own console commands.
Refer `the extension example code <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomonitor/tree/main/examples/extension.py>`_
